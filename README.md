Experience with keypoint extraction and measurement-based recommendation systems.


--------------------------------------
To build an AI-based solution that estimates body measurements from two images (front and side poses) and recommends standard clothing sizes (S, M, L), you can follow these steps:
Overview

    Image Processing and Keypoint Detection: Use a pre-trained deep learning model like OpenPose or MediaPipe to detect key body landmarks (such as the waist, shoulders, hips, knees, etc.) from the front and side images.
    Measurement Extraction: Calculate the body measurements (e.g., height, shoulder width, waist circumference) based on the detected keypoints.
    Size Recommendation System: Use the extracted measurements to recommend a clothing size (S, M, L) based on standard sizing charts.

Step 1: Setup Dependencies

You'll need several Python libraries for image processing, deep learning, and machine learning:

pip install opencv-python numpy pandas scikit-learn mediapipe tensorflow

We'll use MediaPipe for keypoint detection, OpenCV for image processing, and NumPy/Pandas for handling data.
Step 2: Detect Keypoints from Images (Front and Side Poses)

MediaPipe provides a powerful solution for pose detection. Below is the Python code for extracting keypoints using MediaPipe.
Code for Keypoint Detection

import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np

# Initialize MediaPipe pose detector
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose(min_detection_confidence=0.5, min_tracking_confidence=0.5)

# Function to extract keypoints from an image
def get_keypoints(image):
    # Convert to RGB (MediaPipe uses RGB format)
    image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    result = pose.process(image_rgb)
    
    if result.pose_landmarks:
        keypoints = []
        for landmark in result.pose_landmarks.landmark:
            keypoints.append([landmark.x, landmark.y, landmark.z])  # x, y, z coordinates
        return keypoints
    else:
        return None

# Load front and side pose images
front_image = cv2.imread('front_pose.jpg')
side_image = cv2.imread('side_pose.jpg')

# Get keypoints for both images
front_keypoints = get_keypoints(front_image)
side_keypoints = get_keypoints(side_image)

# Display keypoints on images (for visualization purposes)
if front_keypoints:
    for point in front_keypoints:
        cv2.circle(front_image, (int(point[0] * front_image.shape[1]), int(point[1] * front_image.shape[0])), 5, (0, 255, 0), -1)
    
    cv2.imshow('Front Pose Keypoints', front_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    
if side_keypoints:
    for point in side_keypoints:
        cv2.circle(side_image, (int(point[0] * side_image.shape[1]), int(point[1] * side_image.shape[0])), 5, (0, 255, 0), -1)
    
    cv2.imshow('Side Pose Keypoints', side_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Key Body Landmarks

    MediaPipe returns a list of 33 landmarks. Some key body landmarks (with respect to clothing size recommendation) might include:
        Front Image:
            Shoulder (left and right)
            Elbows
            Wrists
            Waist
            Hips
        Side Image:
            Waist
            Hips
            Knees
            Shoulders

Step 3: Extracting Body Measurements

Once you have the keypoints from the front and side images, you can compute the body measurements based on distances between the detected keypoints. For example:

    Height: The distance between the top of the head and the feet.
    Shoulder Width: The distance between the left and right shoulder keypoints (from the front view).
    Waist Circumference: The distance between the left and right waist keypoints (from the front view).
    Hip Circumference: The distance between the left and right hip keypoints (from the front view).

You can use Euclidean distance to calculate these measurements.
Code for Measurement Extraction

def calculate_distance(p1, p2):
    """Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points"""
    return np.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0]) ** 2 + (p2[1] - p1[1]) ** 2)

def extract_measurements(front_keypoints, side_keypoints, image_height, image_width):
    measurements = {}

    # Extract Shoulder Width from front view (shoulder left and right keypoints)
    left_shoulder = front_keypoints[11]  # Example index for left shoulder
    right_shoulder = front_keypoints[12]  # Example index for right shoulder
    shoulder_width = calculate_distance(left_shoulder, right_shoulder) * image_width
    measurements['shoulder_width_inches'] = shoulder_width * 39.37  # Convert to inches

    # Extract Waist Circumference (waist keypoints from front view)
    left_waist = front_keypoints[23]  # Example index for left waist
    right_waist = front_keypoints[24]  # Example index for right waist
    waist_width = calculate_distance(left_waist, right_waist) * image_width
    measurements['waist_circumference_inches'] = waist_width * 39.37  # Convert to inches

    # Extract Hip Circumference from front view (hip keypoints)
    left_hip = front_keypoints[24]  # Example index for left hip
    right_hip = front_keypoints[25]  # Example index for right hip
    hip_width = calculate_distance(left_hip, right_hip) * image_width
    measurements['hip_circumference_inches'] = hip_width * 39.37  # Convert to inches

    # Height measurement from side view (head to feet)
    head = side_keypoints[0]  # Head keypoint
    feet = side_keypoints[30]  # Feet keypoint
    height = calculate_distance(head, feet) * image_height
    measurements['height_inches'] = height * 39.37  # Convert to inches

    return measurements

# Assume you have keypoints for front and side images and the image's dimensions (height, width)
image_height, image_width, _ = front_image.shape  # For front and side images

measurements = extract_measurements(front_keypoints, side_keypoints, image_height, image_width)
print("Extracted Measurements (in inches):", measurements)

Step 4: Size Recommendation System

Based on the extracted measurements (height, shoulder width, waist circumference, etc.), you can create a size recommendation system using predefined size charts. The logic can be as simple as comparing the measurements to a standard size chart.
Example Size Chart (Standard)
Measurement	S (Small)	M (Medium)	L (Large)
Waist (inches)	28-30	31-33	34-36
Hip (inches)	34-36	37-39	40-42
Height (inches)	60-65	66-70	71-75
Code for Size Recommendation

def recommend_size(measurements):
    """Recommend clothing size based on extracted measurements."""
    waist = measurements.get('waist_circumference_inches', 0)
    height = measurements.get('height_inches', 0)
    
    # Size Recommendation based on waist and height
    if waist < 30 and height < 65:
        return 'S'
    elif waist <= 33 and height <= 70:
        return 'M'
    elif waist <= 36 and height <= 75:
        return 'L'
    else:
        return 'Out of Size Range'

# Example use case with the measurements from the previous step
recommended_size = recommend_size(measurements)
print(f"Recommended Clothing Size: {recommended_size}")

Step 5: Putting Everything Together

In summary, the entire process can be divided into these key steps:

    Detect keypoints using MediaPipe for the front and side poses.
    Extract body measurements from the keypoints.
    Recommend the clothing size using the extracted measurements and a predefined size chart.

You can further enhance this system by integrating a more sophisticated machine learning model to predict the clothing size based on user data, or even use more advanced pose detection models like OpenPose or PoseNet for better accuracy.
Conclusion

This AI-based solution uses deep learning techniques for keypoint detection and image processing to extract body measurements from two images. It then uses a simple recommendation system to suggest the most appropriate clothing size (S, M, L). The system can be extended to support more complex size charts, custom size recommendations, and improvements in keypoint detection.
